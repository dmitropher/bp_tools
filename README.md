This is a package for configuring blueprint runs for Rosetta in a more portable format with some built in shortcuts. The goal of the package is to provide idiomatic bindings for complex concepts. These should include constraints between types of secondary structures, fragment types, insertion of fixed fragments from pdb/silent files, repeat symmetry, sampling and reporting. The object is to be able to set up either a specific or general blueprint run using these tools and refine or export the run for the future.

File formats: the json format and plaintext descriptions of run parameters are used as much as possible except for in direct configuration for Rosetta runs. The goal is to be able to be agnostic to the fragment assembly method used while still remaining compatible with a conventional rosetta run.

License issues: while pyrosetta is imported and run, no Rosetta code is directly exposed, so this code can be shared independently under its own license. If a conflict of interest is raised by the Rosetta community, it will be addressed by the package maintainers to the satisfaction of all parties. As a consequence, some parts of this package depend on Rosetta, and may fail if your version of Rosetta is incompatible.
